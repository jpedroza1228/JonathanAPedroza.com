I will be creating the data and I am sure there will be issues since the items and the Q-matrix are being created randomly. Along with using the `cmdstanr` package to call on Stan for the Bayesian analyses, I am using the `posterior` package to manipulate the chains, iterations, and draws from the analyses and the `bayesplot` package to visualize the convergence of each parameter included in the bayes net model. I also love to use whatever table producing package I am interested at the time and create a function with html functionality. Specifically, I always include a feature to filter and highlight specific rows. This time I decided to use the `reactable` package. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(12345)\nbern_dist <- function(prob_value)(\n  rbinom(n = 30, size = 1, prob = prob_value)\n)\n\ny <- tibble(\n  y1 = bern_dist(prob = .7),\n  y2 = bern_dist(prob = .74),\n  y3 = bern_dist(prob = .88),\n  y4 = bern_dist(prob = .90),\n  y5 = bern_dist(prob = .64),\n  y6 = bern_dist(prob = .61),\n  y7 = bern_dist(prob = .79),\n  y8 = bern_dist(prob = .89),\n  y9 = bern_dist(prob = .81),\n  y10 = bern_dist(prob = .54),\n  y11 = bern_dist(prob = .60),\n  y12 = bern_dist(prob = .46),\n  y13 = bern_dist(prob = .37),\n  y14 = bern_dist(prob = .3),\n  y15 = bern_dist(prob = .65),\n) |>\n  rowid_to_column() |>\n  rename(\n    studentid = rowid\n  )\n\nq_matrix <- tibble(\n  item_id = map_chr(1:15, ~paste0(\"y\", .x)),\n  att1 = c(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0),\n  att2 = c(0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0),\n  att3 = c(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1)\n) \n\nskills <- 3\nskill_combo <- rep(list(0:1), skills)\nalpha <- expand.grid(skill_combo)\n\nalpha <- alpha |>\n  rename(\n    att1 = Var1,\n    att2 = Var2,\n    att3 = Var3\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    class = seq(1:nrow(alpha)),\n    .before = att1\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe code above is from the previous post as well that discusses the creation of the binary data, the Q-matrix, and the attribute profile matrix.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstan_file <- list(\n  J = nrow(y[,-1]),\n  I = ncol(y[,-1]),\n  K = ncol(q_matrix[,-1]),\n  C = nrow(alpha),\n  X = y[,-1],\n  Q = q_matrix[, -1],\n  alpha = alpha[,-1]\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, it is easiest to put your Stan data into a list. So here I take all the tibbles I created for my data, the Q-matrix, and the attribute profile matrix and only call on the columns and rows that are crucial for the bayes net model. For instance, The **J**, **I**, **K**, and **C** list values are all important for looping through:\n\n- J = The number of rows of data; in this case there are 30 \"students\"\n\n- I = The number of columns in the dataset; which is 15 excluding the first column\n\n- K = The number of latent attributes/skills\n\n- C = The number of rows in the attribute profile matrix. Each row is a latent class with a different set of attribute mastery proficiencies.\n\nAdditionally, we also need to include the actual data to be referenced in our analysis in Stan. For some reason, I decided to shift from **y** for the actual data and then **X** in the analyses. I think I did this from some of the resources I used having X and then other resources using y. In any case, I will draw attention to the data and reference back to the values either being y or X.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(12345)\nmod <-

next part will be different depending on whether or not you are using `RStan` or like in this case `cmdstanR`. If you look up the RStan documentation, I am sure you can find a beginner-friendly tutorial that shows how you would conduct the analysis. For `cmdstanR`, you call on your Stan file. Below is the Stan code or if you'd like to see it side-by-side, the Stan file can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jpedroza1228/log-of-jandp/main/posts/2024-07-10-bayes-net-part2-estimation/simple_bayes_net.stan).

I will use this to compare the accuracy of our model in correctly classifying if students had mastery on all of the attributes.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstu_resp_attr_mean <- stu_resp_attr |>\n  as_tibble() |>\n  summarize(\n    across(\n      everything(),\n      ~mean(.x)\n      )\n  )\n\nstu_resp_attr_class <- stu_resp_attr_mean |>\n  mutate(\n    across(\n      everything(),\n      ~if_else(.x > .5, 1, 0)\n    )\n  )\n\nstu_resp_attr_class <- stu_resp_attr_class |>\n  pivot_longer(\n    everything()\n  ) |>\n  separate(\n    name,\n    into = c(\"stu\", \"att\"),\n    sep = \",\"\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    stu = str_remove(stu, \"\\\\[\"),\n    att = str_remove(att, \"\\\\]\"),\n    att = paste0(\"att\", att),\n    stu = str_remove(stu, \"prob_resp_attr\")\n  ) |>\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = att,\n    values_from = value\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor the probabilities, first I will get the average of the draws for each student and their probability of mastery for each of the three attributes. I again used a threshold of 0.5 for classifying whether a student met mastery of each attribute and then did some manipulation to get the data into a wide format where each attribute is its own column and each student is a row. We can how see how well the model classifies these students into mastery of each attribute. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap2(\n  stu_resp_attr_class[,2:4],\n  actual_stu_resp_attr[,2:4],\n  ~table(.x, .y)\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$att1\n   .y\n.x   0  1\n  1 10 20\n\n$att2\n   .y\n.x   0  1\n  1 11 19\n\n$att3\n   .y\n.x   0  1\n  0  1  2\n  1 15 12\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmap2(\n stu_resp_attr_class[,2:4],\n  actual_stu_resp_attr[,2:4],\n  ~prop.table(\n    table(.x, .y)\n  )\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n$att1\n   .y\n.x          0         1\n  1 0.3333333 0.6666667\n\n$att2\n   .y\n.x          0         1\n  1 0.3666667 0.6333333\n\n$att3\n   .y\n.x           0          1\n  0 0.03333333 0.06666667\n  1 0.50000000 0.40000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs shown above, we can see the counts and percentages for the classification of each attribute. We can see that the problem is that the model is predicting that students are mastering each attribute when they have not mastered the attribute. This is resulting in several false positives for the model. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstu_resp_attr_long <- stu_resp_attr_class |>\n  pivot_longer(-stu)\n\nactual_stu_resp_attr_long <- actual_stu_resp_attr |>\n  pivot_longer(-studentid)\n\naccuracy_att <- mean(stu_resp_attr_long$value == actual_stu_resp_attr_long$value)\naccuracy_att\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.5777778\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinally, I pivoted the data to be long so I could compare the values for the actual responses and the posterior draws to show the accuracy of this model. The accuracy value shows that this model was not that accurate with a value of 0.5777778. This is a good starting point, but this may indicate that the model needs better definied priors and may require the edges between the attributes to show latent relationships. ",
