    "text": "Hi! I am Jonathan Andrew Pedroza, but I have gotten used to everyone just referring to me as JP. I am a Data Scientist and Psychometrician for Accessible Teaching, Learning, and Assessment Systems (ATLAS) at the University of Kansas. My training is as a Prevention Scientist from the University of Oregon, where I received training in program evaluation, implementation science, machine learning, inferential statistics, and survey design. In addition to my work at ATLAS, I am also a Posit (Previously RStudio) Academy Mentor to cohorts around the world where I help cohort members with learning R while providing tips about additional packages and best practices using R and the Tidyverse.\nMy past research interests included the examination of physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and environmental factors that contribute to inequities of access and engagement in health behaviors. Currently my research interests are in using machine learning to draw attention to accessibility concerns for students with significant cognitive disabilities. Additional interests include creating visualizations to disseminate findings to a wide audience, including practitioners, other resaerchers, and state officials.\nMy main programming language is R; however, I am competent in using Python and have working knowledge of SQL, Stan, and Julia. When I am away from my computer, I enjoy EVERYTHING about coffee, hiking, cycling, and playing with my cats. If you have any questions or requests for statistics/machine learning consultation, you can reach me through email Away from my computer I enjoy everything about coffee, hiking, cycling, and playing with my cat. If you have any questions, you can reach me on twitter or through email cpppedroza@gmail.com."
