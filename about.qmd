Hi! I am **J**onathan **And**rew **P**edroza PhD, but I have gotten used to everyone just referring to me as JP. I am currently on the job market looking for any data scientist, data analyst, or psychometrician openings. I received my PhD in Prevention Science from the University of Oregon in 2021. My training as a [Prevention Scientist](http://www.preventionresearch.org/prevscience_description.php) included training in *program evaluation*, *implementation science*, *machine learning*, *inferential statistics*, and *survey design*. I am also a Posit (Previously RStudio) Academy Mentor to cohorts around the world where I guide learners to find answers to their R or Python code. I also provide tips and tricks that I have learned while working in R and Python while also showcasing additional packages and best coding practices.

Some of my research interests include: the examination of physical activity and sedentary behaviors, environmental factors that contribute to inequities of access and engagement in health behaviors, and educational interventions. I am open to learning more about a new field, especially while working with various datasets with my Posit Academy cohorts.

I am proficient in using base R and the Tidyverse, along with Python and SQL for databases. I also have working knowledge using Stan for Bayesian statistics and CSS/HTML for making changes in Shiny applications, interactive documents, and my website. When I am away from my computer, I enjoy EVERYTHING about coffee, hiking, fishing, cooking, and playing with my cats. I'm currently on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/jonathanpedroza.bsky.social) for social media and infrequently check on [Twitter/X/whatever it is called now](https://x.com/jp_prev_uo) and [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@jpedroza).
