Hi! I am **J**onathan **And**rew **P**edroza PhD, but I have gotten used to everyone just referring to me as JP. I am currently on the job market looking for any data analyst, data scientist, or psychometrician openings. I received my PhD in Prevention Science from the University of Oregon in 2021. My training as a [Prevention Scientist](http://www.preventionresearch.org/prevscience_description.php) included training in *program evaluation*, *implementation science*, *machine learning*, *inferential statistics*, and *survey design*. I am also a Posit (Previously RStudio) Academy Mentor to cohorts around the world where I help cohort members with learning R while providing tips about additional packages and best practices using R and the Tidyverse.

My past research interests included the examination of physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and environmental factors that contribute to inequities of access and engagement in health behaviors. Currently my research interests are in using machine learning to draw attention to accessibility concerns for students with significant cognitive disabilities. Additional interests include creating visualizations to disseminate findings to a wide audience, including practitioners, other resaerchers, and state officials and Bayesian analyses. However, I am interested in all types of data and the complex problems associated with them.

My main programming language is R; however, I am competent in using Python and have working knowledge of SQL, Stan, and Julia. When I am away from my computer, I enjoy EVERYTHING about coffee, hiking, cycling, and playing with my cats. Away from my computer I enjoy roasting and tasting different coffees, hiking, cycling, fishing, and playing with my cats. If you have any questions or requests for statistics/machine learning consultation, you can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jp_prev_uo) or through email <a href="mailto:jonpedroza1228@gmail.com">jonpedroza1228@gmail.com</a>.
