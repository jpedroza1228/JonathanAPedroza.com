Hi! I am Jonathan Andrew Pedroza PhD, but I have gotten used to everyone just referring to me as JP. I am currently on the job market looking for any data scientist, data analyst, or psychometrician openings. I received my PhD in Prevention Science from the University of Oregon in 2021. My training as a [Prevention Scientist](https://www.npscoalition.org/prevention-science) included training in *program evaluation*, *implementation science*, *machine learning*, *inferential statistics*, and *survey design*. Currently I am a contractor for Posit (Previously RStudio) where I serve as an Academy Mentor. As a mentor, I train cohorts from organizations around the world to learn data science skills in R and Python, such as data wrangling, data visualization, functional programming, model building, and communicating results using dashboards and reports. Additionally, I provide resources, best coding practices, and examples for useful packages outside of the scope of Academy.

Some of my research interests include: the examination of physical activity and sedentary behaviors, environmental factors that contribute to inequities of access and engagement in health behaviors, and educational interventions. I am open to learning more about a new field, especially since working with various datasets with my Academy cohorts.

I am proficient in using R and Python for data analytics and machine learning, along with SQL for databases. I also have experience using Stan for Bayesian statistics and CSS/HTML for making changes in Shiny applications, interactive documents, and my website. When I am away from my computer, I enjoy roasting and brewing coffee, hiking, fishing, cooking, and playing with my cats. I'm currently on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/jonathanpedroza.bsky.social) for social media and infrequently check [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@jpedroza). You can also email me <a href="mailto:jonpedroza1228@gmail.com"> at jonpedroza1228\@gmail.com</a> with any inquires.
