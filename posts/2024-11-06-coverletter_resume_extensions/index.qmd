I thought I would talk a little bit about my process for creating quarto extensions on a cover letter and resume that I created while on the job market. 

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

quarto use template jpedroza1228/quarto_extensions/Resume

quarto use template jpedroza1228/quarto_extensions/CoverLetter
```
